# 📅 File to Calendar Converter - Product Roadmap

## 🎯 Project Vision

Transform the File to Calendar Converter into the most user-friendly, accurate, and feature-rich calendar event extraction tool available, supporting multiple file formats and providing intelligent event detection with seamless calendar integration.

## 📊 Current Status Assessment

### ✅ Strengths

- **Modern Architecture**: Angular 20+ with TypeScript and standalone components
- **Robust Testing**: 22/22 tests passing with comprehensive coverage
- **Clean Design**: Modern gradient UI with mobile responsiveness
- **Firebase Integration**: Authentication and optional cloud functions
- **Multiple File Support**: Images (JPG, PNG) and PDF processing
- **Advanced Processing**: Tesseract.js OCR and PDF.js text extraction
- **Smart Calendar Generation**: ICS file creation with proper formatting
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions

### ⚠️ Current Limitations

- **Bundle Size**: 847KB (exceeds 500KB budget by 69%)
- **Authentication Requirement**: Blocks usage without Google sign-in
- **Limited File Formats**: No support for DOCX, TXT, or other document types
- **Basic Event Detection**: Limited natural language processing
- **No Calendar Integration**: Manual ICS download only
- **Accessibility Gaps**: Limited screen reader and keyboard navigation support
